Authors: Emi Cervantes, Jenny Tran

## Experiment Descriptions

*   Synthetic experiment 1 (`synthetic-exp1.ipynb`): Compraing iteration and CPU of GK, GKO, and MWRKO.

*   Synthetic experiment 2 (`synthetic-exp2.ipynb`): Comparing iteration and CPU of GK, GKO, and MWRKO using linar syatems of various row sizes.

*   Synthetic experiment 3 (`synthetic-exp3.ipynb`): Comparing iteration and CPU of GK, GKO, and MWRKO using uniform system with various lower bounds.

*   Synthetic experiment 4 (`synthetic-exp4.ipynb`): Comparing iterationa nd CPU of GK, GKO, and MWRKO using corrrelated systems.

*   Synthetic experiment 5 (`synthetic-exp5.ipynb`): Comparing the angles of each system (not considered).

*   Synthetic experiment 6 (`synthetic-exp6.ipynb`): Comparing the convergence rates of GK, GKO, and MWRJO (not considered).
